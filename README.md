A simple example for a hexagonal architecture, using requirements as code.
It contains a use case model and command handlers that control the flow of the application.
Check out the class comments for details.

The main class is `poem.simple.Main`.

 This example is inspired by a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4AgBcrEHA) by A. Cockburn and T. Pierrain on hexagonal architecture.
